# CHANGELOG 📝

The Azure MCP Server updates automatically by default whenever a new release comes out 🚀. We ship updates twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays 😊

## 2.0.0-beta.9 (Unreleased)

### Features Added

- Added Azure Storage Sync (StorageSync) module with 18 commands for managing cloud synchronization of file shares:
  - **StorageSyncService** commands (4): Create, Delete, Get, Update
  - **RegisteredServer** commands (3): Get, Unregister, Update
  - **SyncGroup** commands (3): Create, Delete, Get
  - **CloudEndpoint** commands (4): Create, Delete, Get, TriggerChangeDetection
  - **ServerEndpoint** commands (4): Create, Delete, Get, Update

- Added support logging capability with `--dangerously-write-support-logs-to-dir` option for troubleshooting and support scenarios. When enabled, detailed debug-level logs are written to automatically-generated timestamped log files (e.g., `azmcp_20251202_143052.log`) in the specified folder. All telemetry is automatically disabled when support logging is enabled to prevent sensitive debug information from being sent to telemetry endpoints.
- Added Azure Managed Lustre HSM (Hierarchical Storage Management) autoimport and autoexport job management commands:
  - `managedlustre_fs_blob_autoimport_create` - Create autoimport jobs to sync data from Azure Blob Storage to Lustre filesystem
  - `managedlustre_fs_blob_autoimport_get` - Get details of specific autoimport job(s)
  - `managedlustre_fs_blob_autoimport_cancel` - Cancel running autoimport jobs
  - `managedlustre_fs_blob_autoimport_delete` - Delete autoimport job records
  - `managedlustre_fs_blob_autoexport_create` - Create autoexport jobs to sync data from Lustre filesystem to Azure Blob Storage
  - `managedlustre_fs_blob_autoexport_get` - Get details of specific autoexport job(s)
  - `managedlustre_fs_blob_autoexport_cancel` - Cancel running autoexport jobs
  - `managedlustre_fs_blob_autoexport_delete` - Delete autoexport job records

The default is Entra authentication, users can switch to native database authentication by providing the `--auth-type` parameter with the value `PostgreSQL`. If native authentication is selected, the user must also provide the user password via the `--password` parameter. [[#1011](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1011)]
- Telemetry: [[#1150](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1150)]
  - Enabled telemetry collection for the HTTP transport mode.
  - Refactored Azure Monitor exporter configuration to support multiple exporters with separate user-provided and Microsoft telemetry streams.
  - Added the `AZURE_MCP_COLLECT_TELEMETRY_MICROSOFT` environment variable to control Microsoft-specific telemetry collection (enabled by default).

### Bugs Fixed

- PostgreSQL MCP tools has improved the error message reported in case of failure deserializing some of the columns returned by a query. Non out-of-the-box types like `vector` cannot be deserialized and will now report a clear error message indicating which column caused the issue and an action plan so AI agents can recover from it. [[#1024](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1024)]
- Fixed exit code when invoking `--help` flag. Commands like `tools list --help` now correctly return exit code `0` instead of `1` when successfully displaying help output. [[#1118](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1118)]

### Other Changes

- Added support for text-to-speech synthesis via the command `speech_tts_synthesize`. [[#902](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/902)]

### Breaking Changes

- PostgreSQL MCP tools now require SSL and verify the server's full certificate chain before creating database connections. This SSL mode provides both `eavesdropping protection` and `man-in-the-middle protection`. See [SSL Mode VerifyFull](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/security.html?tabs=tabid-1#encryption-ssltls) for more details. [[#1023](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1023)]


### Bugs Fixed

- Updated a codepath `--mode namespace` where `learn=true` wouldn't always result in agent learning happening. [[#1122](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1122)]
- Use the correct `Assembly` to find `Version` for telemetry. [[#1122](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1122)]

- Added support for User-Assigned Managed Identity via the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable. [[#1033](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1033)]
- Added the following features for deploying as a `Remote MCP Server`:
    - Added support for HTTP transport, including both incoming and outgoing authentication. Incoming authentication uses Entra ID, while outgoing authentication can either use Entra On-Behalf-Of (OBO) or the authentication configured in the host environment. [[#1020](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1020)]
    - Added support for the `--dangerously-disable-http-incoming-auth` command-line option to disable the built-in incoming authentication. Use this option only if you plan to provide your own incoming authentication mechanism, and with caution, as it exposes the server to unauthenticated access. [[#1037](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1037)]
- Enhanced the `tools list` command with new filtering and output options: [[#741](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/741)]
  - Added the `--namespace` option to filter tools by one or more service namespaces (e.g., 'storage', 'keyvault').

  - `foundry_agents_get-sdk-sample`: Get a code sample to interact with a Foundry Agent using the Microsoft Foundry SDK.
  - `foundry_threads_create`: Create a new Microsoft Foundry Agent Thread.
  - `foundry_threads_list`: List all Microsoft Foundry Agent Threads.
  - `foundry_threads_get-messages`: Get messages in a Microsoft Foundry Agent Thread.

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed the `--namespaces` option to `--namespace-mode` in the `tools list` command for better clarity when listing top-level service namespaces. [[#741](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/741)]

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed an issue that spawned child processes per namespace for consolidated mode. [[#1002](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1002)]
- Improved the agent learning experience by ignoring the `command` parameter, which resulted in neither learning nor a tool call to happen. Learning is now always invoked when `learn=true` is passed. [[#1057](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1057)]
- Added descriptions to tool metadata to ensure enough information is present in the CLI to generate docs for metadata. [[#1043](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1043)]

### Other Changes

- Added a `CancellationToken` parameter to `IBaseCommand.ExecuteAsync()` [[#1056](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1056)]
- Added a `CancellationToken` parameter to async methods to many, but not yet all, `I[SomeService]` interfaces [[#1056](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1056)]
- Telemetry:
  - Added `ToolId` into telemetry, based on `IBaseCommand.Id`, a unique GUID for each command. [[#1018](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1018)]

## 0.8.0 (2025-09-18)

### Features Added

- Added the `--insecure-disable-elicitation` server startup switch. When enabled, the server will bypass user confirmation (elicitation) for tools marked as handling secrets and execute them immediately. This is **INSECURE** and meant only for controlled automation scenarios (e.g., CI or disposable test environments) because it removes a safety barrier that helps prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data. [[#486](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/486)]

  - `"prod"`: Production credentials (Environment → Workload Identity → Managed Identity)
  - Specific credential names (e.g., `"AzureCliCredential"`): Target only that credential
  - Improved Visual Studio Code credential error handling with proper exception wrapping for credential chaining
  - Replaced custom `DefaultAzureCredential` implementation with explicit credential chain for better control and transparency
  - For more details, see [Controlling Authentication Methods with AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#controlling-authentication-methods-with-azure_token_credentials)

  - `azmcp_keyvault_key_get`
  - `azmcp_keyvault_secret_get`

### Breaking Changes

- Redesigned how conditionally required options are handled. Commands now use explicit option registration via extension methods (`.AsRequired()`, `.AsOptional()`) instead of legacy patterns (`UseResourceGroup()`, `RequireResourceGroup()`). [[#452](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/452)]
- Removed support for the `AZURE_MCP_INCLUDE_PRODUCTION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. Use `AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS` instead for more flexible credential selection. For migration details, see [Controlling Authentication Methods with AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#controlling-authentication-methods-with-azure_token_credentials). [[#56](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/56)]
- Merged `azmcp_appconfig_kv_lock` and `azmcp_appconfig_kv_unlock` into `azmcp_appconfig_kv_lock_set` which can handle locking or unlocking a key-value based on the `--lock` parameter. [[#485](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/485)]


### Other Changes

- Update `azmcp_foundry_models_deploy` to use "GenericResource" for deploying models to Azure AI Services. [[#456](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/456)]
